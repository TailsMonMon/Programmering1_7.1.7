Programmering 1, exercise 7.1.7

Testing to write some UNICODE characters from a table. Apperently my console can't propperly show anything higher than 255. 
My conclusion is that it works, the UNICODE-table I used is corret (as far as I know) and I can, in theory, write whatever character I want to.
